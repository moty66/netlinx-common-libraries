This project contains globally useful, portable includes for augmenting the base functionality of the proprietary AMX NetLinx language used for programming [AMX NetLinx integrated controllers](http://www.amx.com/products/categoryCentralControllers.asp).

Currently the project provides a math library, string manipulation library, time and date library, array utils, a managed debug messaging library and an associated console output library.
